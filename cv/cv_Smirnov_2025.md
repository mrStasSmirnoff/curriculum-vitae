### **Summary**

Senior Data Scientist specialising in **Payments Optimisation, Routing & Orchestration** and **ML-driven decline reduction** in e-commerce/fintech. I combine DS/ML depth with product thinking to improve authorisation success, PSP routing performance and payment risk posture.

**Key Impact:**
- **4× uplift** in fallback routing success and **~3× increase** in recovered revenue by analysing PSP performance on NA traffic and redesigning a low-performing rerouting path.
- **25–50% improvement** in retry success rates for in-scope transactions through the **Dynamic Retries ML framework**, taken from idea -> PoC -> production rollout.
- End-to-end design of analytics and ML pipelines across **Azure & AWS** (SageMaker, MWAA, Databricks, Data Vault 2.0).

My background spans telecom network optimisation, data engineering, and ML product development, which gives me a strong mix of domain, data and systems thinking. Currently I’m focused on payments orchestration, decline analysis, PSP optimisation and tokenisation behaviour in a merchant-of-record context.

### **Professional Experience**

#### **Cleverbridge AG**
*Cologne, Germany | Hybrid*

**Senior Data Scientist**
*April 2024 – Present | Cologne, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany · Hybrid*
*Payments Team – Payment Routing & Orchestration*

- Improved payment re-routing success by **~4x** (from 2–3% to ~11%) by analysing fallback performance on NA traffic and proposing a switch from a low-performing PSP route to a higher-performing alternative, which led to the corresponding **~3× increase** in recovered revenue on that traffic slice.
- Owning the evolution of the **Dynamic Retries ML system** as part of the payments stack, extending coverage to additional decline categories and use cases.
- Performed deep-dive analysis on BIN-level and regional authorisation patterns across PSPs to identify weak routes and opportunities for optimisation.
- Currently exploring **tokenisation** and network-token performance (coverage, success rates, impact on auth) to inform future routing and retry strategies.
- Acting as a bridge between payments PM, engineering and data, bringing domain and ML context into prioritisation discussions.

**Data Scientist**
*December 2021 – April 2024 | Cologne, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany · On-site*

*CleverAutomations Product (churn reduction)*
- Designed and implemented the ML framework behind **CleverAutomations**, a churn-reduction product that became a core part of the company’s offering.
- Built predictive models (**AWS SageMaker**) and automated workflows (**AWS MWAA**) that identified at-risk customers and triggered targeted campaigns.

*Dynamic Retries Product (payment recovery)*
- Originated the idea for **Dynamic Retries** – using ML to optimise payment retry timing.
- Built the initial PoC, pitched it to senior stakeholders and led the cross-functional team from prototype -> MVP -> production rollout.
- Achieved **25–50% higher success rate** for in-scope retries, significantly increasing recovered purchase volume for key clients.
- Implemented the solution on **AWS** for scalability and reliability (Python microservices, SageMaker, MWAA).

**Data Engineer**
*September 2019 – December 2021 | Cologne Area, Germany · On-site*

- Led the design and implementation of a scalable **Data Warehouse** on Azure (**Data Vault 2.0**), enabling reliable reporting and self-service analytics across the company.
- Built and optimised **ETL pipelines** (**Azure Data Factory**, **Databricks**, **T-SQL**) processing millions of records per day from multiple source systems.
- Managed schema changes and migrations with **Flyway**, ensuring consistent, versioned deployments across environments.
- Developed **Python microservices** and **Airflow** workflows for data products, containerised with **Docker** for resilient, maintainable operation.
