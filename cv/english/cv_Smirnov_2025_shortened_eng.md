### **Professional Experience**

#### **Cleverbridge AG**
*Cologne, Germany | Hybrid*

**Senior Data Scientist**
*April 2024 – Present | Cologne, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany · Hybrid*

*Payments Team – Payment Routing & Orchestration*

- **Impact:** Improved payment re-routing success by ~4x (2–3% -> ~11%) and recovered revenue by ~3x by redesigning fallback logic for NA traffic.
- **Dynamic Retries:** Owning the evolution of the ML system, extending coverage to new decline categories and use cases.
- **Strategy:** Analyzing BIN-level and regional authorisation patterns to identify weak routes; exploring tokenisation performance to inform future routing strategies.
- **Leadership:** Bridging payments PM, engineering, and data to prioritize ML initiatives with high business impact.

**Data Scientist**
*December 2021 – April 2024 | Cologne, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany · On-site*

- **Product Development:** Originated and led Dynamic Retries (payment recovery) from idea -> PoC -> production, achieving 25–50% higher success rate for in-scope retries.
- **Churn Reduction:** Designed the ML framework for CleverAutomations, building predictive models (SageMaker) and workflows (MWAA) to identify at-risk customers.
- **Tech Stack:** Implemented scalable solutions using Python microservices, AWS SageMaker, and MWAA.
